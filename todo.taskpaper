- Fix homebrew-tapping for the fonts cask. (This might actually be solved in git configuration. The problem I ran into is if I just used `tap homebrew/fonts` or whatever, it tried to pull over HTTPS.)
- Fix nix shell detection and don't load asdf if you're in one.

- Move git identity configuration out of .gitconfig and into env vars in .localrc. @done

Low-hanging fruit:
	- Implement `checkout-remote` git alias (see TODO in git config, SO link there).
	- Add guardrails for gh `co` alias when diffs exceed 100 files (see TODO in gh config).
	- Remove `eval` calls from `gp`.
	- Add `fzf`-powered tab-completion to `gp`. @done

Missing packages:
	- Add a `claude` package for ~/CLAUDE.md and Claude Code settings.
	- Add an `fzf` package — .zshrc references it but there's no stowed config.
	- Add an `ssh` package.
	- Look for other binaries and stuff used in .zshrc and similar.
	- Add `dasht` to managed stuff.

Repo improvements:
	- Add per-package Brewfiles so `just install <pkg>` is self-contained (atuin, starship, fzf, fd, ripgrep, git-delta, helix, etc.).
	- Add a GitHub Actions CI workflow (e.g. `stow --simulate` check).
	- Add a light bootstrap script/just target for initial setup.

Config enhancements:
	- Update nvim lazy.nvim lockfile.
	- Sync starship colors with wezterm hardhacker theme.
	- Add per-package boostrapping, like "on install, build a binary".
