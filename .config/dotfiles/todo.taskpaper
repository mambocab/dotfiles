- Fix homebrew-tapping for the fonts cask. (This might actually be solved in git configuration. The problem I ran into is if I just used `tap homebrew/fonts` or whatever, it tried to pull over HTTPS.)
- Fix nix shell detection and don't load asdf if you're in one.

- Move git identity configuration out of .gitconfig and into env vars in .localrc. @done
